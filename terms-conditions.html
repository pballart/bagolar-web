                        <h2>2. License</h2>
                        <p>Unless otherwise stated, Bagolar Studio and/or its licensors own the intellectual property rights for all material on our website and applications. All intellectual property rights are reserved.</p>
                        
                        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on our website or applications for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
                            <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial)</li>

                            <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Bagolar Studio at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>

                        <h2>3. App Usage</h2>
                        <p>By downloading or using any of our mobile applications, these terms will automatically apply to you â€“ you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Bagolar Studio.</p>
                        
                        <p>Bagolar Studio is committed to ensuring that our applications are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.</p>

                        <h2>4. Data and Privacy</h2>
                        <p>Our applications store and process personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that our applications won't work properly or at all.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our applications do use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. We may use services such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a> - for data collection and analysis</li>
                            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a> - for crash reporting and app performance monitoring</li>
                            <li>Other analytics and crash reporting services</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>By using our applications, you agree to be bound by the respective Terms of Service of these third-party services.</p>

                        <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
                        <p>The materials on our website and applications are provided on an 'as is' basis. Bagolar Studio makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
                        
                        <p>Further, Bagolar Studio does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.</p>
                        
                        <p>To the extent that the information and services on the website and applications are provided free of charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature.</p>

                        <h2>6. Limitations</h2>
                        <p>In no event shall Bagolar Studio or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on our website or applications, even if Bagolar Studio or a Bagolar Studio authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
                        
                        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Bagolar Studio will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of our applications will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Bagolar Studio cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.</p>

                        <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
                        <p>We employ the use of cookies. By using our website you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with our privacy policy.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most of the modern day interactive web sites use cookies to enable us to retrieve user details for each visit. Cookies are used in some areas of our site to enable the functionality of this area and ease of use for those people visiting. Some of our affiliate / advertising partners may also use cookies.</p>

                        <h2>8. Accuracy of Materials</h2>
                        <p>The materials appearing on our website and applications could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Bagolar Studio does not warrant that any of the materials on its website or applications are accurate, complete or current. Bagolar Studio may make changes to the materials contained on its website or applications at any time without notice. However Bagolar Studio does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>

                        <h2>11. App Updates and Termination</h2>
                        <p>At some point, we may wish to update our applications. The applications are currently available on iOS and Android â€“ the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Bagolar Studio does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</p>
                        
                        <p>We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

                        <h2>12. Modifications</h2>
